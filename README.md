# Weather App Project
This project guides you through building a weather application that fetches weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API and displays it on a user-friendly interface. You'll gain hands-on experience with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, while incorporating an external API to enhance your web development skills.

## Objectives
Understand the concept of weather APIs and their applications.
Build a basic weather app using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Fetch weather data from an external API (OpenWeatherMap).
Manipulate JSON data retrieved from the API.
Update the user interface dynamically based on fetched data.
### Prerequisites
Basic understanding of HTML structure.
Familiarity with CSS fundamentals for styling.
No prior JavaScript experience is required, but a willingness to learn is essential!
### Tools and Technologies
Text editor or code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text)
Web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox)
OpenWeatherMap account (Free tier available for personal use) OpenWeatherMap API
## Project Outline
The project is divided into the following sections:

### Introduction and Setting Up:
Introduction to weather APIs and their benefits.
Project overview and the technologies involved (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).
Choosing and obtaining an API key from OpenWeatherMap.
Building the User Interface (HTML & CSS):
Creating the basic HTML structure for the app layout (header, search bar, weather display).
Styling the app's visual appearance using CSS (fonts, colors, responsiveness).
Fetching Data and Updating UI (JavaScript):
Fetching weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API using JavaScript's fetch API.
Parsing the JSON response data to extract relevant weather information (temperature, description, etc.).
Dynamically updating the HTML elements in the UI with the retrieved weather data.
